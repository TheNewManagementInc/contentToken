<h2>The blockchain can do more than NFT's></h2>
<p>This contract serves up a base64 from a token and the decoded form is json. Combined with Javascript you can serve up content directly from the token, or just have the fields serve as src links for script. With minified js you can use this to distribute content and serve html, it can be reused acrossed projects to serve html, image link rels, or html and script src. Taking advantage of JS and the document object model which has reached a maturity level where it can do anything actual apps can do along with better security in modern browsers  means you no longer need a webserver or cdn. YOu can store in the token itself the content, and resources for an nft or dapp project. 
<p>This is an early commit of the basic contract</p>
